New Features

    Projectile/Cannonball Mechanic: Players can now create a projectile (cannonball) that is fired at the Creeps. The cannonball takes the position from where the player clicked and shoots in that direction, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.

    Sprint Mechanic: A new sprint feature has been added, allowing players to increase their speed by 1.75 times. This enables players to evade enemies more effectively and escape tight situations.

Gameplay Adjustments

    Size Reduction: The size of both the player character and the Creeps has been decreased for improved gameplay dynamics and better visual clarity.

    Increased Enemy Speed: The speed of enemies has been increased, creating a more challenging experience for players.

    Higher Spawn Rate: The spawn rate of the Creeps has been increased, intensifying the gameplay and keeping players on their toes.

Tracking Progress

    Kill Counter: A kill counter has been implemented, allowing players to track the number of Creeps they defeat instead of just how long they survive. This adds a competitive edge to the game.

How to Play

    Use the mouse to aim and click to shoot cannonballs at the Creeps.
    Press the sprint key to increase your speed and escape danger.
    Try to achieve the highest kill count while surviving.
